INHERITANCE

- an Object takes the properties and methods of another Object
- ables to reuse code in different parts of the application


Inheritance terms:
Base/Super/Parent class
Derived/Sub/Child class

Inheritance relationship: is a
ex. circle is a shape

Two types of inhritance:

Classical vs Prototypical
JS doesn't have classes, only objects.
Prototype is basically the parent of another object.

Every object in JS, except the root object, has a prototype or parent and inherits all the members defined in its prototype.
All objects inherit from the root object.



Objects created by a given constructor will have the same prototype

Prototype is just a regular object in memory
